#What I learned
Although I have experience with the front-end use of Wordpress, this is the first time I have built in the backend of Wordpress It was a challenge to learn all the wordpress-specific functions used for PHP, CSS, and Javascript. This project was extremely challenging but moved faster when working with colleagues and the great staff at RED.
